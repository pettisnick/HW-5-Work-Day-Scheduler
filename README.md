# Work-Day-Scheduler

I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for any hour between 9am and 5pm. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

Here is a link to my deployed application: [Work Day Scheduler](https://pettisnick.github.io/HW-5-Work-Day-Scheduler/)

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks ranging from 9am to 5pm or for the standard business work day
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (light grey), present (red), or future (green)
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter any type of event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events still persist
```

The following images animation demonstrates the application functionality:
